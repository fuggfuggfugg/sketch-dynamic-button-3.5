# Dynamic button plugin for Sketch.app Version 3.5+ 

Dynamic button plug-in for [Sketch.app](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) allows to create buttons with fixed paddings no matter what text you add. 


## Updates 

Version 1.1

* [**Supports Sketch v40.3** (Download)](https://github.com/fuggfuggfugg/sketch-dynamic-button-3.5/archive/master.zip)
* [New] Supports single value in the text layer. 
* ~~[Improve] Plugin now applies to only text layer and ignores any other layers. This way if you <Cmd+j> on other layers it won't apply extra folders. Also if you select multiple layers and <Cmd+j> it will only apply the changes to the text layer and ignore any other layers. You need not worry about making any mistakes and reverting them back.~~
